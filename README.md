Special thanks to all our members for the contribution as the project is growing within an exceptionally friendly and courteous platform. üôè

## Sources

We give references that have influneced the design. Since the majority of plastic parts (even if much improved and somehow "new and different") have their roots in the initial design by Prusa Research we like to mention this as first and most influential reference.
